# EV_Data_Analysis
This Electric Vehicle dataset analysis, conducted during my internship at Innomatics Research Labs, applied various data analysis techniques to uncover fascinating trends. 

**𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 1: 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:**  
I explored electric vehicle ranges, identifying a standardized range with a few outliers. This insight could help manufacturers make informed decisions regarding battery capacities.  
**𝐁𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:**  
Studied the relationship between electric range and model year, revealing that BEVs surpass PHEVs in range, showcasing technological advancements from 2000 to 2020.

**𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 2:**
Created an interactive Choropleth map using Plotly Express to visualize the geographic distribution of EVs. This data visualization revealed fascinating insights into **𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐡𝐢𝐜 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧**, showing that some states and legislative districts are leading in EV adoption, while others could benefit from further infrastructure development.

**𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 3: 𝐕𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:**  
I utilized boxplots to compare top vehicle manufacturers' electric ranges, offering insights on potential areas for improvement. Additionally, I designed a **Racing Bar Plot** to visualize the evolution of EV manufacturers, showcasing the rise of key players in the electric vehicle market.
